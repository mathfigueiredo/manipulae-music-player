# Music Player App by mathfigueiredo
This project was built with React.js, Redux, Deezer API, Axios, Styled-Components, Framer Motion and other cool libraries.

## Project Manual

This App depends on the Deezer API to fetch data and because of that we can just hear a 30 seconds preview of each track. The purpose of this App is NOT to make profit, but for learning and practicing only, and in fact, it helped a lot to improve skills with React, Redux and API requests.

You can check the current version of the App working here: [here](https://mathfigueiredo.com/P/app/MusicPlayerApp/index.html).

Check it out. Add songs to your favorite list, search for tracks/artists/albums, experiment the backward and forward button...

Of course this App is not perfect and there are a tremendous amount of features to implement if we want to build up a high level Music Streaming app. Feel free to suggest any changes to it. You are welcome :)
